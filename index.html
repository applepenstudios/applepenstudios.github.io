      <h1>SF-Marin Food Bank</h1>

      <h2>Their Mission</h2>

      <p>
        The SF Marin FoodBank's mission is to end hunger in San Francisco and Marin.
        <blockquote>
        "Before the pandemic, one in five neighbors was at risk of hunger. Now, we know
        the need is even greater. We address hunger head-on – from our food pantry network
        and home-delivered groceries to CalFresh (food stamp) enrollment. Every week, over
        53,000 households count on us for food assistance. 60% of what we distribute to them
        is fresh fruit and vegetables."
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <h2>My Experience</h2>

      <p>
        My experience with the food bank has always been filled with fun, music, and of course
        food. There usually are some 80s or 90s tunes playing as you put into a box cans, milk,
        cereal, meat, or any other things. The way they make it most efficient is they have it
        in an assembly line style. You get assigned to a job, or you can pick it. It could either
        be putting in some canned fruit, vegetables, meat, or milk, powder milk, cereal. There
        are many more jobs other than handling the canned and prepackaged goods. You can man the
        tape machine, it is a machine that tapes the bottom and top. If you ever go there, know
        that the bottom is not sealed, so be careful. If you want to do a harder job, you can
        lift boxes. By doing this you put it on the pallet that they then wrap and deliver to
        elders across SF and Marin. They always remind you that every box that is made, is handed
        out to one person. So if you made 600 boxes, you would have given food to 600 people.
        Specifically older people. I usually go at least once a month, so I usually have the
        same thing that happens. But there was one time that we worked with raw chicken that
        had frozen from Chick Fil A. I also recommend bringing your gloves. They do have
        disposable gloves there, but it is better to bring your own so you don’t waste gloves.
        At the end of the shift which is around 2-3 hours (it goes by fast) the manager of the
        shift gives you the numbers of boxes you packed, the weight of all the boxes in all,
        and then they lead you out with star wars music, or any other marching music. This is
        also a great opportunity to get volunteer hours for school.

      <h1>Hamotzi</h1>

      <h2>Their Mission</h2>

      <p>
        Hamotzi's mission is to feed people in need and need food. They deliver to Compass
        Family Services, and Women's Place. This program started during the High Holy Days in
        1993. Since then they have served over 150,000 meals to shelters in San Francisco. They
        also have another program inside of Hamotzi for new families called Chesed. Chesed is
        targeted for people who have just had a baby and are starting a new family.
      </p>

      <h2>My Experience</h2>

      <p>
        My experience there was really good, it was full of nice and caring people. When I
        was there I was chopping veggies, and doing prep work. Cleaning tables and packing
        up the food. It is a very good environment and you can always step away and take a
        break. My personal favorite thing to do is cutting veggies because you can get an
        arm workout and also talk to people and meet them. Another thing that they do is you
        have to wear a hair net or a baseball cap to keep hair out of food, and wear gloves
        when handling food. It starts around 9 o’clock, and ends around 12:30.
