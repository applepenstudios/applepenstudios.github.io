            My Bat Mitzvah project was inspired by my love for food and cooking, and also the need for food, because 37.8 million people are currently suffering from food insecurity in the U.S. alone.
            I wanted to try and have an impact on lowering this number, but also to make sure people are fed and happy as food is something that everyone needs. To do that, I volunteered at the SF-Marin Food Bank and Hamotzi at Congregation Sherith Israel.
            Read more below about the two programs that I volunteered at, and the impact they are making for people in the Bay Area.

          The SF Marin FoodBank's mission is to end hunger in San Francisco and Marin.

          "Before the pandemic, one in five neighbors was at risk of hunger. Now, we know
          the need is even greater. We address hunger head-on - from our food pantry network
          and home-delivered groceries to CalFresh (food stamp) enrollment. Every week, over
          53,000 households count on us for food assistance. 60% of what we distribute to them
          is fresh fruit and vegetables."

            My experience with the Food Bank is always filled with fun, music, and of course,
            food. There usually are some '80s or '90s tunes playing as you pack boxes with cans, milk,
            cereal, meat, and many other things. The way they make it most efficient is they have it
            in an assembly line style. You get assigned to a job or you can pick it. It could either
            be putting in some canned fruit, vegetables, meat, or milk, powdered milk, or cereal. There
            are many more jobs other than handling the canned and pre-packaged goods as well. The completed boxes are delivered to
            elders across San Francisco and Marin. The staff that support the volunteers always remind you that every box made is given to one person.
            So if you made 600 boxes, you would have given food to 600 people, specifically older people.
            I usually volunteer at least once a month, and usually experience the same thing.
            But, there was one time that we worked with frozen chicken donated by Chick Fil A.
            I recommend bringing your own gloves. They do have
            disposable gloves there, but it is better to bring your own so you don't waste gloves.
            At the end of the shift, which is around 2-3 hours (it goes by fast), the manager of the
            shift tells you the numbers of boxes you packed, the total weight of all of the boxes packed,
            and then they lead you out of the warehouse with Star Wars music, or other music. This is
            also a great opportunity to get volunteer hours for school.

        <p>
          Hamotzi's mission is to feed people in need of food. They deliver to two shelters, Compass
          Family Services and Women's Place. This program started during the High Holy Days in
          1993. Since then they have served over 150,000 meals to shelters in San Francisco. They
          also have another program inside of Hamotzi for families called Chesed. Chesed is
          targeted for people who would benefit from having a home-cooked meal delivered to them,
          maybe because they have just had a baby or can't cook for themselves for other reasons.

          <p>
            Whenever I volunteer at Hamotzi, my experience is really good, because it is full of nice and caring people.
            When I volunteer, I usually help with prep work, including chopping veggies, making sandwiches, and cutting bread.
            I also help pack up the food and clean after everything is done. It is a very good environment and you can always step away and take a
            break if you need to do so. My personal favorite thing to do is cutting veggies because you can get an
            arm workout and also talk to people and get to know them as you work alongside each other.
            You have to wear a hair net or a baseball cap to keep your hair out of the food and wear gloves
            when handling food. Volunteer shifts start around 9:00am and ends around 12:30pm on Sundays.
