      <p>
      Mom was cleaning downstairs. We just moved and her radio was blaring. You could hear it from the attic! Ugh! I moved my diary closer to the window and got out of my seat. It screeched on the floor. I wish it were quieter.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mom, can you please turn the radio down?” I asked, almost yelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What did you say jelly bean?” Mom shouted up the stairs. We just moved to this rickety house that, whenever I walk down the stairs I think it’s going to break under me so I hold extra tight onto the railing.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why can’t we just stay with dad. He has a really nice house!” I said, Mom finally turns the radio down and sighs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        “You wouldn’t get it, just go unpack and organize your room.” Mom says, and turns the radio up.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mom! Why do you have the radio up so high?!” I scream, she starts talking but I can’t hear her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What!?” I ask again.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So, then I know what’s going on when I’m not next to the radio!” Mom answers, I sigh and turn the radio off completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hey, what did you do that for?” She asked, almost spilling the bucket of water. She puts the sponge on top of the water so it floats. Then it starts to sink into the suds. 
      </p>
      <p>
        “Because you won’t listen to anything I say! At least listen to music!” I felt like a parent and my mom was like a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
        I walk upstairs, Mom turns the radio on and plugs in the vacuum, she turns the radio up once more and starts vacuuming under the moth eaten sofa. The previous owners left it for us to take care of. It makes me mad sometimes. When we lived with dad and I was really upset she said to throw these rocks and try to make it into the hole she created. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn’t do it anymore because I never got it into the hole and it always landed in one of Dad’s planters. One day he covered it up in anger and I couldn’t do it anymore so I did what I used to do which was throw pillows at the door and yes he banned me from doing that too. So basically I had nothing to do when I was angry, and just stewed in my madness until it passed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, she created a hole but it was hard to see from my window in the backyard when we arrived, the first thing she did was that. She also found a lot of rocks in the backyard. They sit in a ceramic pot next to the window with a sign that says: <strong>WHEN YOU’RE ANGRY, OPEN WINDOW AND THROW ROCK</strong>. My mom trusted me a lot. But when I lied she was really angry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Mom was finally done cleaning for the day (it didn’t look cleaned at all), she went and warily plopped herself on the moth-eaten sofa.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I saw her I said: “You know that was eaten by moths, and there are probably eggs somewhere.” I said, she didn’t seem to mind ‘cause all she said was this: “I just need to sit down and rest for an hour.” And she dozed off, I dug into a box that was labeled: LIVING ROOM. I pulled back the tabs and searched for a blanket, I did and draped it over my mom. With effort (and not succeeding) I tried putting my mom in a lying position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I went into my room and spotted a letter on one of my boxes that said: <span class="handwriting">To: May Brown, From: Tod Brown.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn’t resist, but to read it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It said:
      </p>
      <pre class="handwriting">
        Dear May,

        I want to invite you to my ranch, my address is this: 259 Cow Ranch. Please pay a visit when you can!

        With love from your,
        Husband

        I stared at it in shock. It was dated: 8-16-1913. That was forty years ago!
