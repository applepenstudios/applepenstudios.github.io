      <p>
      Who was this Tod Brown? And why was he sending letters to my grandma!? And how did mom get a hold of this? I ran down stairs, and started waving the letter in my mom’s face.
      </p>
      <p>
      “What is this?” I ask, Mom wiggles around and opens her eyes half way.
      </p>
      <p>
      “What?” She slurs, I wave it closer in her face.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Oh, ya that.” She says and bats it away and closes her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Where did you find this?” I ask, Mom opens her eyes fully and stares at it for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
      “I got it when we were cleaning out your grandparents house when Grandma May died.” Mom explains.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Oh, but who is this Tod Brown? He signed it: with love from your Husband!” I say, Mom laughs.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Sweetie, that’s your grandfather! He married my mother.” Mom says, I look at her confused.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Melody, your grandfather passed away before you were born. Ok, that’s all I’m going to say, now please let me sleep.” She says and dozes off again.
      </p>
      <p>
      I wonder why she didn’t tell me more! Maybe she knows as much as I know, or maybe she is hiding something! I got it! She’s hiding something about my grandparents. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I stared at the yellow stained paper, it looked like it was stuffed into a box or cabinet because the lines weren’t fold lines they were crumple lines. I put it on my desk and took out a magnifier and stared through it, like the detectives in the movies I watch. (I watch too many Sherlock Holmes movies!)
      </p>
      <p>
        The naked eye can’t see all the details! So after I put the magnifier down I felt hopeless. Maybe there was a sigh from my grandpa to tell me more about him! Mom told me everything that she will tell me. So I couldn’t get any more information from her about my grandpa, I’d never even met him in real life! Just saw a man in photos standing on the left of mom and her brother with Grandma May on the right side.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess I could call Arthur (mom’s brother) and try and extract information from him, and maybe better yet, visit Cow Ranch and gather clues from there and piece the puzzle together! I ran downstairs and dashed downstairs to find mom’s phone. When I found it I dialed Arthur’s phone number.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hello?" Arthur's voice rang through my ear.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hello, this is Melody Brown." I paused and waited for him to say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Melody!" He shouted on the phone, I pulled it away from my ear. I almost wanted to snap mom's flip phone shut!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Uncle Arthur at your service. What's your question?" Arthur asked all serious, which made me crack up, he started laughing too.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Umm, I have a question, can you tell me more about your dad?" I asked, Arthur sucked in a breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is this for a summer project about grandparents?" He asked, I nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, it is." I lied, I don't like lying to my family, it makes me feel like there's a big weight on my stomach.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, couldn't you ask your mom?" He asked, I scratched my head.
      </p>
      <p>
        "She's asleep." This time I told the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ahh, well. He was very kind hearted, you know. And he was very enigmatic." I cut him off.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What does enigmict mean?" I ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, it's en-e-g-mat-tic." He put in.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It means mysterious. We never knew what he was actually doing most of the time except when he was working on the ranch, he fed the pigs and sheep and milked the goats and cattle."
      </p>
      <p>
        "After he did that he just disappeared into the barn house and did who knows what." He said, I had my mouth half open, my hand that was holding the phone loosened. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hmm, so you're saying after he did all that he just disappeared?" I asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes." He responded. I started pacing and looking for a notepad or anything to write something down! I found a piece of paper and a pencil in one of the boxes in my room. I wrote down the three things we knew:
      </p>
      <ol class="handwriting">
        <li>Grandpa worked on a ranch</li>
        <li>He took care of his sheep, goats, and cattle every morning</li>
        <li>He disappeared after he was done doing his chores</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I tapped the paper and it made a hollow sounding sound. I laid it on my desk like it was cursed. I put my feet up onto the seat and sat down, the phone rested sorta in my armpit and shoulder area.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Anything else?" I asked, I could hear Uncle Arthur thinking really hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That's about it, ya." He said I felt accomplished. I stared at the paper as the sun started setting, it was almost dinner and I had to wake Mom up and help her make dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have to get my mom up and start making dinner." I said, Arthur made a sound that told me he understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I will try and get information about Grandpa, and see if I can go to Cow Ranch and see if there are any clues." I said, in my head I was thinking wrap it up, wrap it up!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, you want to go to Cow Ranch? I can always drive you there, it's actually not far from the house you live in right now!" He said, I wrote that down as a note.
      </p>
      <ol class="handwriting">
        <li>Grandpa worked on a ranch</li>
        <li>He took care of his sheep, goats, and cattle every morning</li>
        <li>He disappeared after he was done doing his chores</li>
        <li>We live near to Cow Ranch and Uncle Arthur can drive us</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I smiled as the sun hit my face. I really need to wrap this conversation up and wake Mom up, and make dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I need to wake Mom up and make dinner. You've really been a great help! Bye Uncle Arthur!" I say.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Bye, Melody!" Arthur says, I hear a beep and he hangs up, I hang up and put Mom's phone back. When I'm downstairs I wake Mom up and we start making dinner.
