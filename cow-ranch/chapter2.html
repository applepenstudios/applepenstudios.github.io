      <p>
      Who was this Tod Brown? And why was he sending letters to my grandma!? And how did mom get a hold of this? I ran down stairs, and started waving the letter in my mom’s face.
      </p>
      <p>
      “What is this?” I ask, Mom wiggles around and opens her eyes half way.
      </p>
      <p>
      “What?” She slurs, I wave it closer in her face.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Oh, ya that.” She says and bats it away and closes her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Where did you find this?” I ask, Mom opens her eyes fully and stares at it for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
      “I got it when we were cleaning out your grandparents house when Grandma May died.” Mom explains.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Oh, but who is this Tod Brown? He signed it: with love from your Husband!” I say, Mom laughs.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Sweetie, that’s your grandfather! He married my mother.” Mom says, I look at her confused.
      </p>
      <p>
      “Melody, your grandfather passed away before you were born. Ok, that’s all I’m going to say, now please let me sleep.” She says and dozes off again.
      </p>
      <p>
      I wonder why she didn’t tell me more! Maybe she knows as much as I know, or maybe she is hiding something! I got it! She’s hiding something about my grandparents. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I stared at the yellow stained paper, it looked like it was stuffed into a box or cabinet because the lines weren’t fold lines they were crumple lines. I put it on my desk and took out a magnifier and stared through it, like the detectives in the movies I watch. (I watch too many Sherlock Holmes movies!)
